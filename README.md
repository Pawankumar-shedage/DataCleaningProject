## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming the Nashville Housing dataset to prepare it for analysis. 
The dataset contains information on property sales in Nashville,including details like sale date, sale price, property address, and whether the property was sold as vacant.
Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the data.

**Objectives**

Identify and handle missing values.
Standardize categorical values.
Correct data entry errors.
Normalize data formats.
Ensure consistency across the dataset.
Key Cleaning Steps
Handling Missing Values:

Identify missing values in the dataset.
Decide on an appropriate strategy for dealing with missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Standardizing Categorical Values:

Convert categorical values to a standardized format.
Example: Converting 'Y' and 'N' in the SoldAsVacant column to 'Yes' and 'No'.
Correcting Data Entry Errors:

Identify and correct typos and inconsistencies.
Example: Standardizing address formats and correcting any misspelled entries.
Normalizing Data Formats:

Ensure that dates, currency, and other formats are consistent.
Example: Converting all date fields to a standard format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Ensuring Consistency:

Verify that the data is consistent across all records.
Example: Ensuring that the SoldAsVacant field contains only 'Yes' or 'No' after standardization.

## Usage
To run the SQL script and clean the data:

Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/nashville-housing-data-cleaning.git](https://github.com/Pawankumar-shedage/DataCleaningProject)

Execute the script to clean the dataset.

## Conclusion

Data cleaning is an essential step in the data analysis process. This project demonstrates the importance of preparing a dataset for accurate and meaningful analysis. By following the steps outlined in this project, we ensure that the Nashville Housing dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis.
